# Welcome to UniCollab - Where Collaboration Fuels Innovation!

## Introduction

UniCollab is not just a platform; it's a community-driven ecosystem that empowers students to showcase their projects, collaborate with peers, and dive deep into the world of innovation. Whether you're looking to share your latest project, explore cutting-edge creations, or simply connect with like-minded individuals, UniCollab is the place to be.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the UniCollab repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SUGAM-ARORA/UniCollab.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
cd UniCollab
npm install
```

### 3. Start the Development Server

Launch the development server and explore UniCollab:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and visit [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to experience UniCollab firsthand.

### 4. Test the app

Launch the test runner in the interactive watch mode:

```bash
npm test
```

### 5. Build the app

Build the app for production to the build folder:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command builds the app for production, bundling React in production mode and optimizing the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include hashes. Your app is now ready to be deployed!

### 6. Preview the Build

To preview the production build locally, you can use the following command:

```bash
npm run serve
```

### 7. Configuration

If you need to customize the build tool and configuration choices, you can edit the vite.config.js file. Vite offers a more flexible and easier-to-configure setup compared to CRA.
