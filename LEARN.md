# Welcome to UniCollab - Where Collaboration Fuels Innovation!

## Introduction

UniCollab is not just a platform; it's a community-driven ecosystem that empowers students to showcase their projects, collaborate with peers, and dive deep into the world of innovation. Whether you're looking to share your latest project, explore cutting-edge creations, or simply connect with like-minded individuals, UniCollab is the place to be.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the UniCollab repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SUGAM-ARORA/UniCollab.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
cd UniCollab
npm install
```

### 3. Start the Development Server

Launch the development server and explore UniCollab:

```bash
npm start
```

Open your browser and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to experience UniCollab firsthand.

### 4. Test the app 

Launch the test runner in the interactive watch mode:

```bash
npm test
```

### 5. Build the app 

Build the app for production to the build folder:

```bash
npm build
```

This command builds the app for production, bundling React in production mode and optimizing the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include hashes. Your app is now ready to be deployed!

### 6. Eject the app

If you're not satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices and want full control over them, you can eject at any time:

```bash
npm eject
```

Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back. This command will remove the single-build dependency from your project, copying all the configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. It's important to note that you don’t have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
