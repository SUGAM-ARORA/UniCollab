This video is about exploring cpp as a language to build something, do something creative instead of just doing CP with it. CP is fun but core essence of learning a programming language is to build something out of it. If you are not building something, there is something wrong in your learning approach.\nYou might not agree with me and it's ok. Challenge the idea, not the person.\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/HiteshChoudharyPage\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/hiteshchoudharyofficial\nhomepage: http://www.hiteshChoudhary.com\n\nDisclaimer:\nIt doesn't feel good to have a disclaimer in every video but this is how the world is right now. \nAll videos are for educational purposes and use them wisely.
