      "publishedDate": "2016",
      "description": "To build high-quality software, you need to write testable code. That's harder than it seems: it requires insights drawn from arenas ranging from software craftsmanship to unit testing, refactoring to test-driven development. Most programming books either discuss testing only briefly, or drill down on just one or two techniques, with little guidance on how to systematically verify code. Most testing books, on the other hand, focus on a specific testing process, without showing how to write software that can be easily and systematically tested. In Developer Testing, leading software engineering consultant Alexander Tarnowski strikes an optimal balance, integrating insights from multiple disciplines to help frustrated practitioners get better results. Drawing on his extensive experience as a mentor and trainer, he offers insights that help you accelerate through the typical software assurance learning curve, so you can progress far more rapidly. Tarnowski organizes his insights into \"chunks\" to help you quickly absorb key concepts, and focuses on technology-agnostic approaches you can keep using with any new language, platform, or toolset. The first guide to cover testing mindset, techniques, and applications from the developer's perspective, Developer Testing will help developers get what they really want: better code. -- Provided by publisher.",

      "publishedDate": "2021-01-12",
      "description": "Jeff Lawson, developer turned CEO of Twilio (one of Bloomberg Businessweek's Top 50 Companies to Watch in 2021), creates a new playbook for unleashing the full potential of software developers in any organization, showing how to help management utilize this coveted and valuable workforce to enable growth, solve a wide range of business problems, and drive digital transformation. From banking and retail to insurance and finance, every industry is turning digital, and every company needs the best software to win the hearts and minds of customers. The landscape has shifted from the classic build vs. buy question, to one of build vs. die. Companies have to get this right to survive. But how do they make this transition? Software developers are sought after, highly paid, and desperately needed to compete in the modern, digital economy. Yet most companies treat them like digital factory workers without really understanding how to unleash their full potential. Lawson argues that developers are the creative workforce who can solve major business problems and create hit products for customers—not just grind through rote tasks. From Google and Amazon, to one-person online software companies—companies that bring software developers in as partners are winning. Lawson shows how leaders who build industry changing software products consistently do three things well. First, they understand why software developers matter more than ever. Second, they understand developers and know how to motivate them. And third, they invest in their developers' success. As a software developer and public company CEO, Lawson uses his unique position to bridge the language and tools executives use with the unique culture of high performing, creative software developers. Ask Your Developer is a toolkit to help business leaders, product managers, technical leaders, software developers, and executives achieve their common goal—building great digital products and experiences. How to compete in the digital economy? In short: Ask Your Developer.",

      "description": "“A must read for all developers that want to begin serious Android development.” —Justin Anderson, Freelance Android Developer “From start to finish, this book contains a variety of great tips and insight into the most important attributes of Android design. This book will definitely be required reading for any of our future Android engineers.” —Cameron Banga, Cofounder, 9magnets, LLC There’s a downside to Android’s amazing openness and versatility: it’s easy for developers to write code that’s inefficient, unreliable, insecure, or hard to maintain. In Android Development Patterns , enterprise Android developer Phil Dutson helps you leverage Android 5.0+’s amazing power without falling victim to those pitfalls. Dutson presents today’s most comprehensive set of patterns and procedures for building optimized, robust apps with Android 5.0+. First, Dutson guides you through establishing a highly efficient development environment and workflow, and testing your app to ensure that your code works just as you expect. Then, he walks through the modern best practices for structuring apps, using widgets and components, and working with views. You learn how to build apps that are easy to manage and update, deliver accurate and up-to-date information without wasting precious battery power, and take advantage of new hardware, such as Android Wear and Android TV. Dutson concludes by presenting powerful strategies for optimizing your apps and packaging them for distribution. Coverage includes Using testing to build more trustworthy, dependable, maintainable apps Understanding subtle but critical differences between Android and traditional Java programming Building consistent, modern user interfaces with views and layouts Leveraging the proven MVC pattern to cleanly organize logic Creating rich visual experiences with 3D graphics, animation, and media Simplifying capture and use of location data with the new Locations API Integrating optional hardware, such as Bluetooth, NFC, or USB Building better apps with Google Play Services Creating Android Wear notifications and apps Tuning and improving apps with Google Analytics Designing Android TV apps for the “ten foot view” informit.com/aw https://github.com/dutsonpa/adp-files",

      "description": "\"Two thumbs up\" —Gregory V. Wilson, Dr. Dobbs Journal (October 2004) No one can disparage the ability to write good code. At its highest levels, it is an art. But no one can confuse writing good code with developing good software. The difference—in terms of challenges, skills, and compensation—is immense. Coder to Developer helps you excel at the many non-coding tasks entailed, from start to finish, in just about any successful development project. What's more, it equips you with the mindset and self-assurance required to pull it all together, so that you see every piece of your work as part of a coherent process. Inside, you'll find plenty of technical guidance on such topics as: Choosing and using a source code control system Code generation tools--when and why Preventing bugs with unit testing Tracking, fixing, and learning from bugs Application activity logging Streamlining and systematizing the build process Traditional installations and alternative approaches To pull all of this together, the author has provided the source code for Download Tracker, a tool for organizing your collection of downloaded code, that's used for examples throughout this book. The code is provided in various states of completion, reflecting every stage of development, so that you can dig deep into the actual process of building software. But you'll also develop \"softer\" skills, in areas such as team management, open source collaboration, user and developer documentation, and intellectual property protection. If you want to become someone who can deliver not just good code but also a good product, this book is the place to start. If you must build successful software projects, it's essential reading.",

      "description": "A visual and accessible guide to JavaScript and jQuery in a built-to-last hardcover edition In JavaScript & jQuery renowned author Jon Duckett discards the traditional programming book template and approaches writing code in a more relevant, less intimidating way. Full-color and packed with instructional graphics and photos, his books have gained a loyal following by illustrating programming in a way both instructive for newcomers and invaluable for seasoned coders. By discussing JavaScript and jQuery in a single text, Duckett ensures you will quickly be writing your own working scripts. Yet the book doesn't assume you have experience in either JavaScript or jQuery. By making use of popular jQuery plugins, Duckett illustrates techniques that would require pages upon pages of detailed explanation if you were being taught to create the plugins yourself. This durable and attractive hardcover edition is a book you will have open on your desk as a reference for years to come. A timeless and lasting version of a classic \"Duckett\" book in a hardbound, dust-jacketed edition Completely accessible to those who feel intimidated by the subject matter and relevant to all front-end designers and developers who need to understand JavaScript Discusses applying responsive design techniques, leveraging APIs to save you time and work in coding, and identifying when to use CSS transforms over pure JavaScript Beautiful 4-color illustrations and examples make this a terrific academic resource for those of all experience levels JavaScript & jQuery clearly explains the jargon of programming, addressing the vocabulary without making it a prerequisite for readers. Duckett speaks directly to readers, making this an invaluable resource. This book is also available as a set, Web Design with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery Set 978119038634 along with HTML and CSS Design and Build Websites 9781118871645.",

      "publishedDate": "2018-12-04",
      "description": "Completely revised and updated, this best-selling introduction to programming in JavaScript focuses on writing real applications. JavaScript lies at the heart of almost every modern web application, from social apps like Twitter to browser-based game frameworks like Phaser and Babylon. Though simple for beginners to pick up and play with, JavaScript is a flexible, complex language that you can use to build full-scale applications. This much anticipated and thoroughly revised third edition of Eloquent JavaScript dives deep into the JavaScript language to show you how to write beautiful, effective code. It has been updated to reflect the current state of Java¬Script and web browsers and includes brand-new material on features like class notation, arrow functions, iterators, async functions, template strings, and block scope. A host of new exercises have also been added to test your skills and keep you on track. As with previous editions, Haverbeke continues to teach through extensive examples and immerses you in code from the start, while exercises and full-chapter projects give you hands-on experience with writing your own programs. You start by learning the basic structure of the JavaScript language as well as control structures, functions, and data structures to help you write basic programs. Then you'll learn about error handling and bug fixing, modularity, and asynchronous programming before moving on to web browsers and how JavaScript is used to program them. As you build projects such as an artificial life simulation, a simple programming language, and a paint program, you'll learn how to: - Understand the essential elements of programming, including syntax, control, and data - Organize and clarify your code with object-oriented and functional programming techniques - Script the browser and make basic web applications - Use the DOM effectively to interact with browsers - Harness Node.js to build servers and utilities Isn't it time you became fluent in the language of the Web? * All source code is available online in an inter¬active sandbox, where you can edit the code, run it, and see its output instantly.",

If you are new to JavaScript, it will teach you the language. If you are already a JavaScript programmer, Part I will sharpen your skills and deepen your understanding of the language. Part II explains the scripting environment provided by web browsers, with a focus on DOM scripting with unobtrusive JavaScript. The broad and deep coverage of client-side JavaScript is illustrated with many sophisticated examples that demonstrate how to: Generate a table of contents for an HTML document Display DHTML animations Automate form validation Draw dynamic pie charts Make HTML elements draggable Define keyboard shortcuts for web applications Create Ajax-enabled tool tips Use XPath and XSLT on XML documents loaded with Ajax And much more Part III is a complete reference for core JavaScript. It documents every class, object, constructor, method, function, property, and constant defined by JavaScript 1.5 and ECMAScript Version 3. Part IV is a reference for client-side JavaScript, covering legacy web browser APIs, the standard Level 2 DOM API, and emerging standards such as the XMLHttpRequest object and the canvas tag. More than 300,000 JavaScript programmers around the world have madethis their indispensable reference book for building JavaScript applications. \"A must-have reference for expert JavaScript programmers...well-organized and detailed.\" -- Brendan Eich, creator of JavaScript",

      "description": "A New York Times bestseller and Oprah Book Club 2.0 selection, the epic, unforgettable story of a man determined to protect the woman he loves from the town desperate to destroy her. This beautiful and devastating debut heralds the arrival of a major new voice in fiction. Ephram Jennings has never forgotten the beautiful girl with the long braids running through the piney woods of Liberty, their small East Texas town. Young Ruby Bell, “the kind of pretty it hurt to look at,” has suffered beyond imagining, so as soon as she can, she flees suffocating Liberty for the bright pull of 1950s New York. Ruby quickly winds her way into the ripe center of the city—the darkened piano bars and hidden alleyways of the Village—all the while hoping for a glimpse of the red hair and green eyes of her mother. When a telegram from her cousin forces her to return home, thirty-year-old Ruby finds herself reliving the devastating violence of her girlhood. With the terrifying realization that she might not be strong enough to fight her way back out again, Ruby struggles to survive her memories of the town’s dark past. Meanwhile, Ephram must choose between loyalty to the sister who raised him and the chance for a life with the woman he has loved since he was a boy. Full of life, exquisitely written, and suffused with the pastoral beauty of the rural South, Ruby is a transcendent novel of passion and courage. This wondrous page-turner rushes through the red dust and gossip of Main Street, to the pit fire where men swill bootleg outside Bloom’s Juke, to Celia Jennings’s kitchen, where a cake is being made, yolk by yolk, that Ephram will use to try to begin again with Ruby. Utterly transfixing, with unforgettable characters, riveting suspense, and breathtaking, luminous prose, Ruby offers an unflinching portrait of man’s dark acts and the promise of the redemptive power of love. Ruby was a finalist for the PEN America Robert Bingham Debut Novel Award, a Barnes & Noble Discover Great New Writers selection, and an Indie Next Pick.",

While other books focus on Ruby's trendier features, The Book of Ruby reveals the secret inner workings of one of the world's most popular programming languages, teaching you to write clear, maintainable code. You'll start with the basics—types, data structures, and control flows—and progress to advanced features like blocks, mixins, metaclasses, and beyond. Rather than bog you down with a lot of theory, The Book of Ruby takes a hands-on approach and focuses on making you productive from day one. As you follow along, you’ll learn to: –Leverage Ruby's succinct and flexible syntax to maximize your productivity –Balance Ruby's functional, imperative, and object-oriented features –Write self-modifying programs using dynamic programming techniques –Create new fibers and threads to manage independent processes concurrently –Catch and recover from execution errors with robust exception handling –Develop powerful web applications with the Ruby on Rails framework Each chapter includes a \"Digging Deeper\" section that shows you how Ruby works under the hood, so you'll never be caught off guard by its deceptively simple scoping, multithreading features, or precedence rules. Whether you're new to programming or just new Ruby, The Book of Ruby is your guide to rapid, real-world software development with this unique and elegant language.",

      "description": "It’s easy to write correct Ruby code, but to gain the fluency needed to write great Ruby code, you must go beyond syntax and absorb the “Ruby way” of thinking and problem solving. In Eloquent Ruby, Russ Olsen helps you write Ruby like true Rubyists do–so you can leverage its immense, surprising power. Olsen draws on years of experience internalizing the Ruby culture and teaching Ruby to other programmers. He guides you to the “Ah Ha!” moments when it suddenly becomes clear why Ruby works the way it does, and how you can take advantage of this language’s elegance and expressiveness. Eloquent Ruby starts small, answering tactical questions focused on a single statement, method, test, or bug. You’ll learn how to write code that actually looks like Ruby (not Java or C#); why Ruby has so many control structures; how to use strings, expressions, and symbols; and what dynamic typing is really good for. Next, the book addresses bigger questions related to building methods and classes. You’ll discover why Ruby classes contain so many tiny methods, when to use operator overloading, and when to avoid it. Olsen explains how to write Ruby code that writes its own code–and why you’ll want to. He concludes with powerful project-level features and techniques ranging from gems to Domain Specific Languages. A part of the renowned Addison-Wesley Professional Ruby Series, Eloquent Ruby will help you “put on your Ruby-colored glasses” and get results that make you a true believer.",

      "description": "There is no shortage of programming languages and frameworks out there. But in the midst of all this, Ruby on Rails stands out. Despite losing out on the top spot to other contenders, Ruby on Rails has earned for itself a position of repute and a robust user base. Ever since its debut in 2004, Ruby on Rails has rapidly become one of the most impactful and popular tools for building dynamic web applications. Rails owes much of its success to its compact design and the usage of the underlying Ruby language. It effectively creates a domain-specific language for writing web applications. As a result, many common web programming tasks—such as generating HTML, making data models, and routing URLs—are easier with Rails. Although its outstanding capabilities have made Ruby on Rails one of the world’s most popular web development frameworks, some might still find it challenging to learn and use. Mastering Ruby on Rails: A Beginner’s Guide could be just the right solution for that. Whatever your previous web development experience is, Mastering Ruby on Rails can guide you to true Rails proficiency. It will help you to: Install and set up your Rails development environment Go beyond generated code to build Rails applications from scratch Effectively use the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern Master the Ruby programming skills all Rails developers need Define high-quality site layouts and data models Add social features and navigate Asynchronous Javascript and XML (Ajax) Mastering Ruby on Rails will walk you through Rails' inner workings and equip you to tackle complicated projects with solutions that are well-tested, adaptive, and easy to maintain. This book starts by explaining critical points behind object-oriented programming and builds toward creating a full Rails application within a few chapters. By the end of this book, besides in-depth knowledge of Rails, you will also have a basic understanding of many supporting technologies such as SQL, web frameworks, and Integrated Development Environment (IDE). You will be able to quickly grasp the Rails methodology by focusing on the development from the point of view of the beginner-level developer. Additionally, you will be provided with a reliable roadmap for migrating your applications, skill set, and development procedures to the newer, more flexible programming platform that Rails offers. Moreover, learning Rails development independently will let you use all the qualities like creativeness, critical thinking, and project management. Mastering Ruby on Rails serves as a complete guide to exploring Ruby on Rails, expanding your set of skills and experience that will only benefit you throughout your professional life.

RoR has grown year over year in notoriety and popularity among developers because its ease of use and speed for which a Web developer can build and maintain Web sites and applications. One of its key principles is using less code for application development by avoiding redundancy and following Rails conventions, encouraging increased performance, but with less development time. Ruby on Rails Bible takes all that is key to this framework and programming language and details it in one concise guide for all user levels. Coverage includes an introduction and summary of the Ruby programming language, followed by complete in-depth coverage of the Ruby on Rails framework. In addition to chapters detailing all of the features of Rails, a separate section of the book will provide a walkthrough of the development of a complete Rails web application utilizing much of what is taught earlier in the book. Current hot development trends including Agile development, Web Services, Web 2.0, and Ajax will be covered from the Rails perspective too.",

      "description": "Nikola Tesla was a major contributor to the electrical revolution that transformed daily life at the turn of the twentieth century. His inventions, patents, and theoretical work formed the basis of modern AC electricity, and contributed to the development of radio and television. Like his competitor Thomas Edison, Tesla was one of America's first celebrity scientists, enjoying the company of New York high society and dazzling the likes of Mark Twain with his electrical demonstrations. An astute self-promoter and gifted showman, he cultivated a public image of the eccentric genius. Even at the end of his life when he was living in poverty, Tesla still attracted reporters to his annual birthday interview, regaling them with claims that he had invented a particle-beam weapon capable of bringing down enemy aircraft. Plenty of biographies glamorize Tesla and his eccentricities, but until now none has carefully examined what, how, and why he invented. In this groundbreaking book, W. Bernard Carlson demystifies the legendary inventor, placing him within the cultural and technological context of his time, and focusing on his inventions themselves as well as the creation and maintenance of his celebrity. Drawing on original documents from Tesla's private and public life, Carlson shows how he was an \"idealist\" inventor who sought the perfect experimental realization of a great idea or principle, and who skillfully sold his inventions to the public through mythmaking and illusion. This major biography sheds new light on Tesla's visionary approach to invention and the business strategies behind his most important technological breakthroughs.",

      "description": "*A Wall Street Journal Business Bestseller* 'A deeply reported and business-savvy chronicle of Tesla's wild ride' --Walter Isaacson 'A masterclass in narrative journalism' --Bradley Hope 'Exemplary' --The Times 'An exceptional work' --Washington Post Inside the outrageous, come-from-behind story of Elon Musk and Tesla's bid to build the world's greatest car and the race to drive the future. Elon Musk is among the most controversial titans of Silicon Valley. To some he's a genius and a visionary and to others he's a mercurial huckster. Billions of dollars have been gained and lost on his tweets and his personal exploits are the stuff of tabloids. But for all his outrageous talk of mind-uploading and space travel, his most audacious vision is the one closest to the ground: the electric car. When Tesla was founded in the 2000s, electric cars were novelties, trotted out and thrown on the scrap heap by carmakers for more than a century. But where most onlookers saw only failure, a small band of Silicon Valley engineers and entrepreneurs saw potential and they pitted themselves against the biggest, fiercest business rivals in the world, setting out to make a car that was quicker, sexier, smoother, cleaner than the competition. Tesla would undergo a truly hellish fifteen years, beset by rivals, pressured by investors, hobbled by whistleblowers, buoyed by its loyal supporters. Musk himself would often prove Tesla's worst enemy--his antics repeatedly taking the company he had funded himself to the brink of collapse. Was he an underdog, an antihero, a conman, or some combination of the three? Wall Street Journal tech and auto reporter Tim Higgins had a front-row seat for the drama: the pileups, wrestling for control, meltdowns, and the unlikeliest outcome of all, success. A story of power, recklessness, struggle, and triumph, Power Play is an exhilarating look at how a team of eccentrics and innovators beat the odds... and changed the future.",

It is often said that with its business model and its special strategic moves, Tesla confuses competitors, utilities and marketing agencies. Therefore, this assignment will focus on the analysis of the key aspects of Tesla’s business model in order to find out why it is considered to be different. Moreover, the objective of this assessment is to find out, whether this strategy is useful, or if it should be changed. The market definition and analysis of the first assignment is hereby the basis for this evaluation of Tesla Motor’s current marketing strategy. Therefore, the focus will be again on the company’s domestic market: the United States of America. Furthermore, only Tesla’s automotive products will be taken into consideration – its recently launched home battery will not be object of this work.",

Any city at any distance whatsoever from the enemy can be destroyed by him and no power on Earth can stop him from doing so.” —Nikola Tesla, circa 1925 Drawing on forty years of research and a treasure trove of new information, Tesla: Wizard at War provides a comprehensive view of Tesla’s discoveries, which continue to influence today’s military technology and diplomatic strategies. One of the world’s leading Tesla experts, Marc J. Seifer offers new insight into the brilliant scientist’s particle beam weapon (aka the “Death Ray”) and explores his military negotiations with pivotal historical figures—including his links to Joseph Stalin, Vannevar Bush, General Andrew McNaughton, and Franklin Delano Roosevelt. From Tesla’s role in the origins of Star Wars technology and his dynamic theory of gravity, to the real purpose behind the iconic tower at Wardenclyffe, this is an eye-opening account of Tesla’s projects, passions, and ambitions—and an illuminating, important study of one of history’s most intriguing figures.",

There was a time when major English writers – P. G. Wodehouse, Arthur Conan Doyle, Alec Waugh – took time off to write about cricket, whereas the cricket book market today is dominated by ghosted autobiographies and statistical compendiums. The Picador Book of Cricket celebrates the best writing on the game and includes many pieces that have been out of print, or difficult to get hold of, for years. Including Neville Cardus, C. L. R. James, John Arlott, V. S. Naipaul, and C. B. Fry, this anthology is a must for any cricket follower or anyone interested in sports writing elevated to high art.",

This book contains an impressive array of Gulu’s articles on a wide range of sports with an emphasis on cricket which is so close to Gulu’s heart. There are numerous articles on the India Premier League in this collection stretching back to its origins and the reader can judge for himself how perceptive Gulu has been on this vexing issue. On this we share common ground and many of our dire predictions on what we both consider a cancer in the game have proved uncannily correct. Besides controversies, there is much to celebrate as well in this anthology and I wish both the book and its author all the best while looking forward to another such collection 20 years down the line! —from the Foreword ofBishan Singh Bedi",

It provides detailed examples of how data mining can be helpful for decision-making in sports with special reference to cricket, particularly the quantitative features related to Twenty20 cricket, the latest and the most popular format of the game. The book highlights the performance quantification of cricketers (batsmen, bowlers, all-rounders, and wicket keepers), determining the market valuation of cricketers based on their on-field performances and the effect of age on the performance of the cricketers. It also provides a comprehensive overview of the different aspects of the game where quantitative techniques are beneficial, and highlights the use of statistical and data mining tools in analysing sports-related data and objective decision-making in sports. The book appeals to a wide readership, including postgraduate students of statistics/mathematics, data analysts, sports management bodies. It also offers data miners, such as researchers in statistics, mathematics, operations research, and computer science ideas for projects.",

Yet, when it comes to writing on the history of the game, Indians have been reticent and much of the past has been obscured and lost. Majumdar here recovers this history and restores it to its rightful place in India's rich sporting heritage.",

      "description": "Beginning COBOL for Programmers is a comprehensive, sophisticated tutorial and modular skills reference on the COBOL programming language for established programmers. This book is for you if you are a developer who would like to—or must—add COBOL to your repertoire. Perhaps you recognize the opportunities presented by the current COBOL skills crisis, or are working in a mission critical enterprise which retains legacy COBOL applications. Whatever your situation, Beginning COBOL for Programmers meets your needs as an established programmer moving to COBOL. Beginning COBOL for Programmers includes comprehensive coverage of ANS 85 COBOL features and techniques, including control structures, condition names, sequential and direct access files, data redefinition, string handling, decimal arithmetic, subprograms, and the report writer. The final chapter includes a substantial introduction to object-oriented COBOL. Benefiting from over one hundred example programs, you’ll receive an extensive introduction to the core and advanced features of the COBOL language and will learn to apply these through comprehensive and varied exercises. If you've inherited some legacy COBOL, you’ll be able to grasp the COBOL idioms, understand the constructs, and recognize what's happening in the code you’re working with. Today’s enterprise application developers will find that COBOL skills open new—or old—doors, and this extensive COBOL reference is the book to help you acquire and develop your COBOL skills.",

      "description": "This is the latest edition of our classic COBOL book that has set the standard for structured design and coding since the mid-1970s. So if you want to learn how to write COBOL programs the way they're written in the best enterprise COBOL shops, this is the book for you. And when you're done learning from this book, it becomes the best reference you'll ever find for use on the job. Throughout the book, you will learn how to use COBOL on IBM mainframes because that's where 90% or more of all COBOL is running. But to work on a mainframe, you need to know more than just the COBOL language. That's why this book also shows you: how to use the ISPF editor for entering programs; how to use TSO/E and JCL to compile and test programs; how to use the AMS utility to work with VSAM files; how to use CICS for developing interactive COBOL programs; how to use DB2 for developing COBOL programs that handle database data; how to maintain legacy programs. If you want to learn COBOL for other platforms, this book will get you off to a good start because COBOL is a standard language. In fact, all of the COBOL that's presented in this book will also run on any other platform that has a COBOL compiler. Remember, though, that billions of lines of mainframe COBOL are currently in use, and those programs will keep programmers busy for many years to come.",

Covering first the advantages of COBOL over other programming languages, the book discusses COBOL's divisions - identification, environment, procedure, and data, and then describes the testing of the COBOL source programs and program questions. The book is valuable for those who wish to learn basic COBOL language, but do not have the time to take manufacturers' or technical college courses. Intended readers include experienced computer programmers familiar with other programming languages but not with COBOL, as well as students taking a course in computer science. The book is also helpful as it includes self-assessment questions for readers to ensure they understood the principles covered.",

      "description": "COBOL for Students has established itself as one of the most successful teaching texts on COBOL programming and is now in its fourth edition. The first part of the book concentrates on the fundamentals of the language and takes students to the point where they can write modestly sized programs using sequential files. Part two assumes competence in elementary COBOL and explains design and other programming techniques which should be part of the professional programmer's repertoire. Part three extends the student's knowledge of the language by explaining some of the more advanced features of COBOL. Written for students learning COBOL for the first time, it takes the reader from the basic fundamentals right through to some of the more advanced features in one handy, and inexpensive volume. As many lecture courses have been based upon earlier editions of this book, this edition maintains the highly successful style and format and has been updated to include the 'Intrinsic Function Module for COBOL'. (This is the ANSI Standard X3.23a-1989 (COBOL 89) which has also been adopted as ISO International Standard 1989 Addendum 1 (an addendum to the ANSI Standard X3.23-1985 (COBOL 85)) and consists mainly of 42 predefined functions related to many different application areas).",

      "description": "As the conversion of legacy systems continues, the ability to understand embedded business rules becomes more and more critical. This ability is directly related to the structure of the programs within those systems. We also see the need to teach structured programming to a new generation of programmers who must maintain the billions of lines of existing COBOL code. The ultimate purpose of this text is to discuss how to judge the level of structure of a program. We do this by defining structured programming and then discussing how a structured program can be built through the application of the concepts of coupling and cohesion. We also show how embedded business rules of the program can be separated from the data and presentation functions. The reader will be able to use to these skills to judge and to improve the structure of a new program or an existing program.",

      "description": "A detailed introduction to the C programming language for experienced programmers. The world runs on code written in the C programming language, yet most schools begin the curriculum with Python or Java. Effective C bridges this gap and brings C into the modern era--covering the modern C17 Standard as well as potential C2x features. With the aid of this instant classic, you'll soon be writing professional, portable, and secure C programs to power robust systems and solve real-world problems. Robert C. Seacord introduces C and the C Standard Library while addressing best practices, common errors, and open debates in the C community. Developed together with other C Standards committee experts, Effective C will teach you how to debug, test, and analyze C programs. You'll benefit from Seacord's concise explanations of C language constructs and behaviors, and from his 40 years of coding experience. You'll learn: How to identify and handle undefined behavior in a C program The range and representations of integers and floating-point values How dynamic memory allocation works and how to use nonstandard functions How to use character encodings and types How to perform I/O with terminals and filesystems using C Standard streams and POSIX file descriptors How to understand the C compiler's translation phases and the role of the preprocessor How to test, debug, and analyze C programs Effective C will teach you how to write professional, secure, and portable C code that will stand the test of time and help strengthen the foundation of the computing world.",

One of the best-selling programming books published in the last fifty years, \"K&R\" has been called everything from the \"bible\" to \"a landmark in computer science\" and it has influenced generations of programmers. Available now for all leading ebook platforms, this concise and beautifully written text is a \"must-have\" reference for every serious programmer’s digital library. As modestly described by the authors in the Preface to the First Edition, this \"is not an introductory programming manual; it assumes some familiarity with basic programming concepts like variables, assignment statements, loops, and functions. Nonetheless, a novice programmer should be able to read along and pick up the language, although access to a more knowledgeable colleague will help.\"",

      "description": "The goal of this book is to teach the skills necessary to build iOS 14 applications using SwiftUI, Xcode 12 and the Swift 5.3 programming language. Beginning with the basics, this book provides an outline of the steps necessary to set up an iOS development environment together with an introduction to the use of Swift Playgrounds to learn and experiment with Swift. The book also includes in-depth chapters introducing the Swift 5.3 programming language including data types, control flow, functions, object-oriented programming, property wrappers and error handling. An introduction to the key concepts of SwiftUI and project architecture is followed by a guided tour of Xcode in SwiftUI development mode. The book also covers the creation of custom SwiftUI views and explains how these views are combined to create user interface layouts including the use of stacks, frames and forms. Other topics covered include data handling using state properties in addition to observable, state and environment objects, as are key user interface design concepts such as modifiers, lists, tabbed views, context menus, user interface navigation, and outline groups. The book also includes chapters covering graphics drawing, user interface animation, view transitions and gesture handling, WidgetKit, document-based apps and SiriKit integration. Chapters are also provided explaining how to integrate SwiftUI views into existing UIKit-based projects and explains the integration of UIKit code into SwiftUI. Finally, the book explains how to package up a completed app and upload it to the App Store for publication. Along the way, the topics covered in the book are put into practice through detailed tutorials, the source code for which is also available for download. The aim of this book, therefore, is to teach you the skills necessary to build your own apps for iOS 14 using SwiftUI. Assuming you are ready to download the iOS 14 SDK and Xcode 12 and have an Apple Mac system you are ready to get started.",

      "description": "Learn SwiftUI by designing and building complex user interfaces for watchOS, iPadOS, and iOS with the help of projects including a financial app, a sports news app, and a POS system Key Features Learn SwiftUI with the help of practical cross-platform development projects Understand the design considerations for building apps for different devices such as Apple Watch, iPhone, and iPad using SwiftUI's latest features Work with advanced SwiftUI layout features, including SF Symbols, SwiftUI grids, and forms in SwiftUI Book Description Released by Apple during WWDC 2019, SwiftUI provides an innovative and exceptionally simple way to build user interfaces for all Apple platforms with the power of Swift. This practical guide involves six real-world projects built from scratch, with two projects each for iPhone, iPad, and watchOS, built using Swift programming and Xcode. Starting with the basics of SwiftUI, you'll gradually delve into building these projects. You'll learn the fundamental concepts of SwiftUI by working with views, layouts, and dynamic types. This SwiftUI book will also help you get hands-on with declarative programming for building apps that can run on multiple platforms. Throughout the book, you'll work on a chart app (watchOS), NBA draft app (watchOS), financial app (iPhone), Tesla form app (iPhone), sports news app (iPad), and shoe point-of-sale system (iPad), which will enable you to understand the core elements of a SwiftUI project. By the end of the book, you'll have built fully functional projects for multiple platforms and gained the knowledge required to become a professional SwiftUI developer. What you will learn Understand the basics of SwiftUI by building an app with watchOS Work with UI elements such as text, lists, and buttons Create a video player in UIKit and import it into SwiftUI Discover how to leverage an API and parse JSON in your app using Combine Structure your app to use Combine and state-driven features Create flexible layouts on iPad Who this book is for SwiftUI Projects is intended for anyone who is already comfortable with Swift. We do not cover Swift topics in detail, so you need to be familiar with these already. All of the SwiftUI topics are taught as if this is the first time you've learned them and will gradually get more difficult.",

Beginning with the basics, this book provides an outline of the steps necessary to set up an iOS development environment together with an introduction to the use of Swift Playgrounds to learn and experiment with Swift. The book also includes in depth chapters introducing the Swift 5 programming language including data types, control flow, functions, object-oriented programming, property wrappers and error handling. An introduction to the key concepts of SwiftUI and project architecture is followed by a guided tour of Xcode in SwiftUI development mode. The book also covers the creation of custom SwiftUI views and explains how these views are combined to create user interface layouts including the use of stacks, frames and forms. Other topics covered include data handling using state properties and both observable and environment objects, as are key user interface design concepts such as modifiers, lists, tabbed views, context menus and user interface navigation. The book also includes chapters covering graphics drawing, user interface animation, view transitions and gesture handling. Chapters are also provided explaining how to integrate SwiftUI views into existing UIKit-based projects and explains the integration of UIKit code into SwiftUI. Finally, the book explains how to package up a completed app and upload it to the App Store for publication. Along the way, the topics covered in the book are put into practice through detailed tutorials, the source code for which is also available for download. The aim of this book, therefore, is to teach you the skills necessary to build your own apps for iOS 13 using SwiftUI. Assuming you are ready to download the iOS 13 SDK and Xcode 11 and have an Intel-based Mac you are ready to get started.",

      "description": "Tame the power of Apple’s new user interface toolkit, SwiftUI. Integrate all the interface elements iOS users have come to know and love, such as buttons, switches, pickers, toolbars, and sliders with less effort and more efficiency. You’ll also learn about touch gestures, lists, and grids for displaying data on a user interface. And you’ll even go beyond those simple controls to liven up any user interface with simple animation techniques. Spice your designs up with movement, scaling, and resizing, including spring and bounce effects! You’ll start with basic designs and then explore more sophisticated ones. Assuming little or no working knowledge of the Swift programming language, and written in a friendly, easy-to-follow style, this book offers a comprehensive course in iPhone and iPad programming. The book starts with a gentle introduction to using Xcode and then guides you though the creation of your first simple application. You’ll create user interfaces for that application using multiple screens in two different ways—using Navigation View and Tab Bars. Beginning iPhone Development with Swift UI covers the basic information you need to get up and running quickly to turn your great ideas into working iOS apps with stunningly interactive interfaces using SwiftUI. Once you’re ready, move on to Pro iPhone Development with Swift UI to learn more of the unique aspects of iOS programming and the Swift language. What You Will Learn Discover the basics of designing a user interface using SwiftUI Build cool, crisp user interfaces that use animation Display data in lists and outlines Organize user interfaces in forms and groups Who This Book is For Aspiring iOS app developers new to the Apple Swift programming language and/or the iOS SDK.",

This textbook adopts an integrated approach, linking traditional functions of the current financial system (payments, traded assets, fundraising, regulation) with the respective functions in the crypto market, in order to facilitate the reader in their understanding of how this new ecosystem works. The book walks the reader through the main features of the blockchain technology, the definitions, classifications, and distinct characteristics of cryptocurrencies and tokens, how these are evaluated, how funds are raised in the cryptocurrency ecosystem (ICOs), and what the main regulatory approaches are. The authors have compiled more than 100 sources from different sub-fields of economics, finance, and regulation to create a coherent textbook that provides the reader with a clear and easily understandable picture of the new world of encrypted finance and its applications. The book is primarily aimed at business and finance students, who already have an understanding of the basic principles of how the financial system works, but also targets a more general readership, by virtue of its broader scope and engaging and accessible tone.",

      "description": "The real-life trades and strategies of a successful cryptocurrency trader Glen Goodman's goal was to retire young and wealthy, escaping the daily grind. He taught himself how to trade everything from shares to Bitcoin and made enough money to realise his dream and quit his day job while still in his 30s. In The Crypto Trader, Glen will show you exactly how he made huge profits trading Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and more, so that you can do it too - without risking your shirt. Glen publicly called the top of the market in December 2017 and took his profits before the crash. But there are still tons of trading opportunities out there and Glen continues to trade crypto successfully. Inside you'll see his multi-hundred-percent gains on a raft of cryptocurrencies and learn how he builds his profits and holds onto them. Glen reveals all his trading strategies, the proven methods and rules that make him one of the most followed traders in the world on social media. (He is also frequently interviewed by the BBC, Forbes and LBC, and is a contributing expert on cryptocurrency at the London School of Economics.) It took Glen years of study and trial and error to become a consistent money maker. He learnt his trading lessons the hard way - so you don't have to. With The Crypto Trader by your side, you'll learn how to grab opportunities, make money - and keep it.",

      "description": "In late 2008, under the long shadow cast by the most severe economic crisis in generations, a revolutionary new form of currency was quietly being shaped. At the time no one could have predicted that an obscure form of electronic money would in less than a decade prove to be the most important financial innovation of the 21st century—a tool that would spark an entire new economic institution: crypto economy. That once-obscure money was known as Bitcoin, and today it is the highest valued digital coin. And though consumers continue to scramble to cash in on the trending currency, the technology behind Bitcoin known as Blockchain, which allows the currency to bought and sold without regulation by a government, remains a mystery to the public. In Crypto Economy, Aries Wanlin Wang provides the definitive blueprint for understanding how Bitcoin, Blockchain, and other digital technologies are disrupting traditional financial institutions and forever changing the world of commerce.",

      "description": "Competition, the drive for efficiency, and continuous improvement ultimately push businesses toward automation and later towards autonomy. If a business can operate without human intervention, it will minimize its operational cost. If Uber can remove the expense of a driver with an autonomous vehicle, it will provide its service cheaper than a competitor who can’t. If an artificially intelligent trading company can search, find, and take advantage of some arbitrage opportunity, then it can profit where its competitors cannot. A business that can analyze and execute in real-time without needing to wait for a human to act, is a business that will be able to take advantage of brief inefficiencies from other markets or businesses. This trend following a thesis that is based on 100 years of proven economic theory. Short-wave economic cycles, those 5- to 10-year cycles, are driven by credit but the long-wave economic cycles, those 50- to 60-year cycles, are driven by technological revolution. We’ve had 5 cycles over the past 200 years with the last wave, the Age of Information & Telecommunications. We've seen evidence that a new cycle has begun. Technological revolutions come by way of a cluster of new innovations. About a decade ago, you started to see AI, robotics and IoT (sensors) delivering on automation. That’s been powerful, but not transformational. It does not force businesses to fundamentally change how they do business. The last piece of the puzzle was cryptocurrency because it allows us to process and transfer economic value without human intervention. Soon, there will be a global race to build autonomous operations. Businesses and organizations without autonomous operations simply will not be able to compete with those that do because … autonomy is the ultimate competitive advantage. Crypto is the mechanism that will accrue value from being the infrastructure for the next digital financial revolution. Crypto Asset Investing lays out a case that we’ve begun a new technological revolution similar to the Internet Age of the 1990’s. Artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, robotics and cryptocurrency are converging to deliver on a new age, what I call the Age of Autonomy. Understanding the transformation that’s taken place before anyone else can yield enormous investment opportunity. In this book, you’ll learn how and why to invest in crypto assets.",

      "description": "Crypto-Finance, Law and Regulation investigates whether crypto-finance will cause a paradigm shift in regulation from a centralised model to a model based on distributed consensus. This book explores the emergence of a decentralised and disintermediated crypto-market and investigates the way in which it can transform the financial markets. It examines three components of the financial market – technology, finance, and the law – and shows how their interrelationship dictates the structure of a crypto-market. It focuses on regulators’ enforcement policies and their jurisdiction over crypto-finance operators and participants. The book also discusses the latest developments in crypto-finance, and the advantages and disadvantages of crypto-currency as an alternative payment product. It also investigates how such a decentralised crypto-finance system can provide access to finance, promote a shared economy, and allow access to justice. By exploring the law, regulation and governance of crypto-finance from a national, regional and global viewpoint, the book provides a fascinating and comprehensive overview of this important topic and will appeal to students, scholars and practitioners interested in regulation, finance and the law.",

      "description": "Crypto currency integrated BlockChain under Virtual Scalable Enterprises is a widely debated and earnestly discussed topic in the technology arena. Executives at the largest institutions are calling crypto currency fraudulent while high-level institutional banking professionals are leaving their positions to jump into crypto technology, regulation and investment opportunities as industries advance towards adoption. The narratives on these topics are diametrically opposite and polarizing on both side of the debate. While this debate has many layers from a government regulatory side to social impact to the practicality of everyday use of crypto currencies in developing markets, it is safe to assume that crypto currencies or utility tokens are more than a global phenomenon and are now becoming a working framework for optional modes of business. This book demystifies what crypto currency is, how it is used, and what it means to the consumer, investor, and the future of our global currency marketplace. By providing the historical backdrop to the market, authors Sarah Swammy, Richard Thompson, and Marvin Loh provide a clear definition of what crypto-currencies actually are, how they are being used and by whom, and the unique reasons why they have gone from back street to Main Street almost overnight. The book will also delve into the government’s role in regulating this commerce medium. Lastly, the authors will look at the current global monetary policy and discuss if this type of currency phenomena was a direct result while also examining the potential risk and rewards for investors and the economy.",

      "description": "The crypto wars have raged for half a century. In the 1970s, digital privacy activists prophesied the emergence of an Orwellian State, made possible by computer-mediated mass surveillance. The antidote: digital encryption. The U.S. government warned encryption would not only prevent surveillance of law-abiding citizens, but of criminals, terrorists, and foreign spies, ushering in a rival dystopian future. Both parties fought to defend the citizenry from what they believed the most perilous threats. The government tried to control encryption to preserve its surveillance capabilities; privacy activists armed citizens with cryptographic tools and challenged encryption regulations in the courts. No clear victor has emerged from the crypto wars. Governments have failed to forge a framework to govern the, at times conflicting, civil liberties of privacy and security in the digital age—an age when such liberties have an outsized influence on the citizen–State power balance. Solving this problem is more urgent than ever. Digital privacy will be one of the most important factors in how we architect twenty-first century societies—its management is paramount to our stewardship of democracy for future generations. We must elevate the quality of debate on cryptography, on how we govern security and privacy in our technology-infused world. Failure to end the crypto wars will result in societies sleepwalking into a future where the citizen–State power balance is determined by a twentieth-century status quo unfit for this century, endangering both our privacy and security. This book provides a history of the crypto wars, with the hope its chronicling sets a foundation for peace.",

      "description": "Uber is one of the most innovative companies of our time. This book provides a detailed analysis of the company and its success, beyond the headlines about safety and culture. Americans are so accustomed to using Uber today that the name of the innovative ride-sharing company has almost become a verb, as in \"to Uber\" somewhere, and yet Uber has been around only since 2010. In less than a decade, Uber has disrupted the ride-hailing industry, from making it easier and more affordable to become an Uber driver than a cab driver to rating riders as well as drivers. As an early pioneer in using technology to create a new business model and new efficiencies, Uber is considered one of the most important case studies in the sharing economy. However, little in-depth information exists on this innovative company. This book traces Uber's origin and evolution in the face of competitive pressures, discusses the company leadership and corporate culture, addresses such controversies as rider and driver safety and sexual harassment of female employees, and explores how the company is addressing these challenges. Students of business, entrepreneurs, and anyone interested in the development and exponential growth of the sharing economy will benefit from reading this book. Provides key insights into the inner workings of the Sharing Economy Delivers a comprehensive overview of Uber's technological innovations, global expansion, and business model Explores the leadership challenges faced by founder Travis Kalanick Reveals how the company has addressed reports of a sexist corporate culture",

      "description": "New York Times bestselling author of The Everything Store Brad Stone takes us deep inside the new Silicon Valley. Ten years ago, the idea of getting into a stranger's car, or walking into a stranger's home, would have seemed bizarre and dangerous, but today it's as common as ordering a book online. Uber and Airbnb are household names: redefining neighbourhoods, challenging the way governments regulate business and changing the way we travel. In the spirit of iconic Silicon Valley renegades like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates, a new generation of entrepreneurs is sparking yet another cultural upheaval through technology. They are among the Upstarts, idiosyncratic founders with limitless drive and an abundance of self-confidence. Young, hungry and brilliant, they are rewriting the traditional rules of business, changing our day-to-day lives and often sidestepping serious ethical and legal obstacles in the process. The Upstarts is the definitive account of a dawning age of tenacity, creativity, conflict and wealth. In Brad Stone's highly anticipated and riveting account of the most radical companies of the new Silicon Valley, we find out how it all started, and how the world is wildly different than it was ten years ago.",

      "description": "What can you learn from the world’s most successful companies? The Marvel Studios Story will help you understand and adopt the competitive strategies, workplace culture, and daily business practices that enabled a struggling comic book publisher to parlay the power of myth and storytelling to become one of history’s most successful movie studios. Marvel characters have been shaping pop culture for decades and when comic books were no longer keeping the company afloat, Marvel Studios was born. Marvel Studios is the multibillion-dollar home to iconic franchises. They are known for creating brilliant multilayered worlds and storylines that allow their audiences to escape into a fantasy and inspire the creative side of every viewer. But, behind those visionaries is a well-oiled storytelling machine dedicated to getting the Hulk’s smash fists in the hands of every child and a sea of Spiderman costumes deployed every Halloween. This book educates readers on how one of the largest creative companies in the planetary universe runs their business and keeps their fans and their parent company, Disney, counting the profits. Through the story of Marvel Studios, you’ll learn: How to recognize and pursue additional revenue streams. How a company can successfully balance the creative with business to appease investors and fans alike. And how to keep a decades-old superhero franchise new and exciting without losing sight of its roots.",

      "description": "Wildlife care and rehabilitation is often on a one-to-one basis and involves a lot of time, care and skill. However, for many years, care of injured wildlife was regarded as a low priority and euthanasia was the recommended option. A lot has changed over the past twenty years and now caring for wildlife casualties is part of everyday life in many veterinary practices. Following on from the major success of the first edition, this second edition provides even more useful information on wildlife care and rehabilitation. As well as covering a whole range of species, with sections on birds, mammals, reptiles and amphibians, this edition now includes information on many 'alien' species appearing in the British countryside such as wallabies, wild boar and exotic reptiles. In this edition: * Essential guidance on handling, first aid, feeding and releasing, and many other disciplines not featured in veterinary or nursing training; * Full of helpful tips from an expert in wildlife rehabilitation who has unparalleled practical experience; * Expanded chapters on the care of all species - particularly casualty badgers, otters and hedgehogs - and more comprehensive guidance on rearing orphaned mammals and birds; * Lots more colour pictures to aid in management and care techniques and the latest information on zoonotic diseases from around the world.",

      "description": "In the past, wildlife living in urban areas were ignored by wildlife professionals and urban planners because cities were perceived as places for people and not for wild animals. Paradoxically, though, many species of wildlife thrive in these built environments. Interactions between humans and wildlife are more frequent in urban areas than any other place on earth and these interactions impact human health, safety and welfare in both positive and negative ways. Although urban wildlife control pest species, pollinate plants and are fun to watch, they also damage property, spread disease and even attack people and pets. In urban areas, the combination of dense human populations, buildings, impermeable surfaces, introduced vegetation, and high concentrations of food, water and pollution alter wildlife populations and communities in ways unseen in more natural environments. For these ecological and practical reasons, researchers and mangers have shown a growing interest in urban wildlife ecology and management. This growing interest in urban wildlife has inspired many studies on the subject that have yet to be synthesized in a cohesive narrative. Urban Wildlife: Theory and Practice fills this void by synthesizing the latest ecological and social knowledge in the subject area into an interdisciplinary and practical text. This volume provides a foundation for the future growth and understanding of urban wildlife ecology and management by: • Clearly defining the concepts used to study and describe urban wildlife, • Offering a cohesive understanding of the coupled natural and social drivers that shape urban wildlife ecology, • Presenting the patterns and processes of wildlife response to an urbanizing world and explaining the mechanisms behind them and • Proposing means to create physical and social environments that are mutually beneficial for both humans and wildlife.",

It is aimed at all three sectors of the age and career spectrum: young people such as gap year students and backpackers; the larger market of vacation conservation volunteers; and the early retired. Peter Lynch investigates rather than lists different types of organisations including charities, clearinghouses, eco-tour operators and travel agents. He audits, analyses and deconstructs them according to a range of verifiable criteria, including their scientific validity.This second edition had been completely updated and expanded, including more organizations, updated assessments, more volunteer stories and more field adventures. There is also a new chapter on great wildlife migration events - how, when and where to see them, with more great photographs. The guide includes long- and short-term opportunities from roughing it in tents, through simple permanent accommodation to quasi-luxury. The extensive range of expedition opportunities include working with antelope, big cats, birds, coral reefs, dolphins, elephants, fish, hippos, monkeys, orang-utans, turtles, whales, zebras, injured wildlife and people - in every type of habitat - all over the globe. First-hand accounts by volunteers reveal the day-to-day life of being a volunteer.",

      "description": "People have relied on medicinal products derived from natural sources for millennia, and animals have long been an important part of that repertoire; nearly all cultures, from ancient times to the present, have used animals as a source of medicine. Ingredients derived from wild animals are not only widely used in traditional remedies, but are also increasingly valued as raw materials in the preparation of modern medicines. Regrettably, the unsustainable use of plants and animals in traditional medicine is recognized as a threat to wildlife conservation, as a result of which discussions concerning the links between traditional medicine and biodiversity are becoming increasingly imperative, particularly in view of the fact that folk medicine is the primary source of health care for 80% of the world’s population. This book discusses the role of animals in traditional folk medicine and its meaning for wildlife conservation. We hope to further stimulate further discussions about the use of biodiversity and its implications for wildlife conservation strategies.",

Conservation of Wildlife Populations provides anaccessible introduction to the most relevant concepts andprinciples for solving real-world management problems in wildlifeand conservation biology. Bringing together insights fromtraditionally disparate disciplines, the book shows how populationbiology addresses important questions involving the harvest,monitoring, and conservation of wildlife populations. Covers the most up-to-date approaches for assessing factorsthat affect both population growth and interactions with otherspecies, including predation, genetic changes, harvest, introducedspecies, viability analysis and habitat loss andfragmentation. Is an essential guide for undergraduates and postgraduatestudents of wildlife biology, conservation biology, ecology, andenvironmental studies and an invaluable resource for practisingmanagers on how population biology can be applied to wildlifeconservation and management.

      "description": "This book takes an informal and entertaining look at some of the most influential football coaches and teams in the game's history as well as exploring some of the origins of football's more wellknown formations and the players who were an integral part of them. By taking an informative yet informal and entertaining look at the history and evolution of football formations and tactics, the author identifies just a few of some of the pioneering figures in the early years of the game, people like Jack Hunter, the visionary coach of Blackburn Olympic who prepared his team for a crucial match by taking them to the seaside for a few days of \"...hard running on the towns famous sands as well as a regular diet of oysters, and, very strictly, no beer\" and the players of Queens Park FC who conceived and played tiki-taka football over a century before Pep Guardiola and his all-conquering Barcelona players were even born. Mapping The Pitch also looks at some of the great international sides in the games history, including the Hungary team which so astonished and captivated the sporting world in the 1950's, not least because of the role played by and exceptional ability of a player very few people will have heard of today, Nándor Hidegkuti, one of the forerunners of the position that made players like Pelé, Cruyff and Maradona so revered in the modern game. It also explores the contemporary theme within the game that sees teams enter matches with a mentality of looking not to lose rather than to win, a telling but subtle difference between football today and how it was half a century and more ago, one typified by an emphasis on midfield domination and possession-one that is not so dissimilar to the priorities teams adopted in mob football in the middle ages.",

      "description": "This book presents a cross-disciplinary examination of the lived experiences of girls and women football players using theoretical insights from sports studies, psychology, sociology and gender studies. It examines the concept of ‘the football self’ – your own, personal football identity that encapsulates the importance of football to our everyday lives – and what that can tell us about the complex relationships between sport, family, gender and identity. The book draws on in-depth ethnographic research involving players and family members, and offers important new insights into the everyday experiences of those girls and women who play. It breaks new ground in focusing on the significant relationships between player and family with a particular focus on parenting through football. The book brings to the fore key debates around gender identity, barriers to participation, cultural gaps and discrimination. The author also brings a personal perspective to bear, drawing on experience gained over 20 years as a player, adding an extra critical layer to her important empirical research. This is essential reading for all researchers and students with an interest in football, sport studies or issues around gender, inclusion or the family in sport, and fascinating reading for anybody generally curious about football.",

      "authors": ["Gary Neville"],

      "publishedDate": "2011-09-01",
      "description": "No player has been more synonymous with the glory years of Manchester United Football Club over the past two decades than right-back Gary Neville. An Old Trafford regular since he attended his first match at the age of six, captain of the brilliant 1992 FA Youth Cup-winning team that became known as 'Fergie's Fledglings', outspoken representative of MUFC, Neville is the ultimate one-club man. He has been at the heart of it all and, at the end of an amazing career, is now ready to tell it all. Authoritative, insightful, fearless and never less than 100% honest, no-one has better credentials for documenting the story of United under Sir Alex Ferguson. Neville reveals the behind-the-scenes secrets of his early days with the likes of Giggs, Scholes and his best mate David Beckham; what it was like to play with Cantona, Keane and Ronaldo; the Treble in 1999; and of course an entire career of playing for the greatest manager in the game. Then there are all his experiences with England, from being the youngest starter at Euro 96 when football came home, to the ups and downs of five major championships and seven managers - Venables, Hoddle, Wilkinson, Keegan, Eriksson, McClaren and Capello. There are opinions and analysis on Gazza, Rooney, WAGs and the true story of the FA and Rio Ferdinand. For twenty glorious years, Gary Neville has worn his heart on his sleeve. This is his story.",

For the first time, legendary F1 commentator Maurice Hamilton and award-winning photographers Bernard and Paul-Henri Cahier bring the heroes of this iconic sport together, in a stunning photographic portrayal of the poise, skill and winning mindset that separates the fast from the furious, the elite from the talented. With exclusive quotes from icons such as Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg, and including Maurice’s historic interviews with the sport’s lost heroes – including James Hunt and Aryton Senna – F1: The Champions is a beautiful tribute to the most ferocious of sports and the incredible sportsmen who drive at the edge in pursuit of greatness.",

      "description": "F1 Mavericks is the story of the grandest, most influential, and most fondly remembered era in Formula 1 racing as seen through the lens of master motorsports photographer, Pete Biro. The period from 1960 to 1982 saw the greatest technological changes in the history of Formula 1 racing: the transition from front engines to rear engines, narrow-treaded tires, massive racing slicks, zero downforce, and neck-wrenching ground effects—and, of course, a staggering increase in performance and reduction in lap times. In short, the period saw the creation of the modern Formula 1 car. This is also the time when legendary names who defined F1 were out in full force: Jim Clark, Jack Brabham, Dan Gurney, Sir Jackie Stewart, Graham Hill, Niki Lauda, James Hunt, Bruce McLaren, Jody Scheckter. We’ll see and meet all of them. But F1 Mavericks also focuses on the designers and engineers behind the cars—men like Colin Chapman, Sir Patrick Head, Maurice Philippe, Franco Rochhi, Gordon Murray, and many others. We’ll hear directly from many of them, including a foreword from 1978 F1 World Champion, Mario Andretti. Every chapter is a photographic account of key races throughout the period, supplemented with sidebars featuring key designers and technologies, like wings, ground effects, slick tires, turbochargers, and the Brabham “fan” suction car. F1 Mavericks is an international story, and includes loads of information on designs from Japan (Honda), Britain (McLaren, Tyrrell, Cooper, BRM) Italy (Ferrari, Maserati, Alfa Romeo), France (Matra, Ligier, Renault), Germany (Porsche, BMW) and the United States (Eagle, Shadow, Penske, Parnelli). Strap yourself in for the story of the greatest era in Formula 1 racing—it's all here in F1 Mavericks.",

      "description": "The adrenaline-fueled, high-octane world of Formula One has created some of the greatest moments in sporting history. From the intense rivalries between teams and drivers, such as Alain Prost and Arton Senns and 2015's Rosberg and Hamilton, to the infamous tracks that have created moments of tragedy and triumph -- F1's greatest moments read like a film script. The Cahier Archive has captured the drama from the 1950's to the present day including Lewis Hamilton's 2015 winning season. It is fulled with stunning behind-the-scenes shots, from pit stops to personal moments, beautiful portraits of the drivers and atmospheric shots of the racing in action. Structured around three sections: Drivers and Rivalries, Teams and Cars, and Tragedy and Triumph of the Circuits, Formula 1: The Pursuit of Speed captures the intensity and beauty of the sport. Each sectionis introduced with vivid essays by F1 correspondent Maurice Hamilton, and filled with the Cahier's beautiful and resonating photographs, many unpublished giving a behind-the-scenes look at the world of F1.",

Revealing the most outrageous secrets and fiercest rivalries, The Mechanic follows Priestley as he travels the world working in the high-octane atmosphere of the F1 pit lane. While the spotlight is most often on the superstar drivers, the mechanics are the guys who make every World Champion, and any mistakes can have critical consequences. However, these highly skilled engineers don't just fine-tune machinery and crunch data through high-spec computers. These boys can seriously let their hair down. Whether it's partying on luxury yachts or gravity-defying photos aboard aeroplanes, this is a world which thrills on and off the track. This is Formula One, but not like you've seen it before.",

      "description": "AUTHOR OF SUNDAY TIMES BESTSELLER, LIFE TO THE LIMIT In his 17 years as a Formula 1 driver, Jenson Button has picked up a thing or two about how to do the job properly. Sure, you need to be able to drive a car fast - and Jenson is on hand to pass on a few tricks of the trade here - but you also need to know the real rules for making it to the top. Like, how to tell a multiple F1 champion they need to check their blind-spot. What the difference is between a helmet and a hat, and indeed a 'helmet-hat'. How to practise your champagne spray ahead of the big day. Why it is never, ever, under any circumstances a good idea to buy a yacht. And how to face down your team when you've just stacked their multi-million-pound car into a wall during practice. But 'JB' (nicknames in F1 run the full range from initials to, well, just using first names) doesn't stop there. HTBAF1D (catchy) lifts the lid on the people, the places, the weird rituals, the motorhomes, the media, the cars, the perks and the disasters. Join Jenson as he reveals how not to race a stupid big truck, why driving Le Mans is like having five shots of tequila before lunch, and what to do when you finally hang up your helmet-hat.",

      "description": "With a foreword by Guenther Steiner - Team Principal of the Haas Formula One Team, Formula 1: The Pinnacle tracks a history of the changes which have taken F1 from its rudimentary beginnings to the exhilarating high octane spectacle it is today. The biggest change in a generation is coming to F1 in 2022. Technical changes aimed at levelling the playing field for the teams combined with the sport’s tightening budget cap will make the races closer than ever. There will be more sprint races – trialled in 2021 – and greater fan interest driven by Netflix’s hugely successful ‘Drive to Survive’ series. So, how did we get here? How did F1 become the acknowledged ‘Pinnacle of Motorsport’? Simon Arron and Tony Dodgins have identified the 100 most significant changes to the series since its inception in 1950. Formula One is unrecognizable from its debut season, where drivers raced around on old bomber training aerodrome in Northamptonshire with oil drums to mark the corners and straw bales the only concession to safety. New fans will welcome a complete and highly illustrated guide to the history of F1, while older fans will be able to compare their own views of what were the pivotal moments of change, in a book written by experienced motoring writers with two lifetimes worth of knowledge of the sport. The book will link technical progress with the personalities involved, indeed many of the swiftest changes have come about as a result of accidents or tragedies – the death of Roland Ratzenberger at Imola in 1994, the same weekend as Ayrton Senna, could have been avoided by the HANS safety device. The introduction of the halo saved Romain Grosjean’s life in Bahrain last year, but only came about because of the tragic accident that claimed Jules Bianchi in Japan. Along with changes to circuits and the technology of the cars, this book highlights the commercial changes and the controversies that threatened to split the sport apart - such as the threat of breakaway series proposed at various times by teams. A must-read for completists or for those new to the sport, F1: The Pinnacle is a fascinating insight into one of the most exciting and dangerous sports in the world.",

This book demonstrates how these applications together can ease your ability to collaborate with others, and allow you access to your documents, mail and appointments from any computer at any location. Of course, as remarkable as these applications are, Google's office suite is definitely a work-in-progress. Navigating what you can and can't do and -- more importantly -- understanding how to do it isn't always easy. And good luck finding enough help online. Google Apps: The Missing Manual is the one book you need to get the most out of this increasingly useful part of the Google empire. This book: Explains how to create, save and share each of Google's web-based office applications Offers separate sections for Docs and Spreadsheets, Google Calendar, and Gmail Demonstrates how to use these applications in conjunction with one another Gives you crystal-clear and jargon-free explanations that will satisfy users of all technical levels Many of you already use Gmail, but do you know its full potential? Do you know how you can increase its power by using Gmail with Doc and Spreadsheets and Google Calendar? You'll find out with Google Apps: The Missing Manual.

At the same time, he illuminates the new worldview of the internet generation: how it challenges and destroys, but also opens up vast new opportunities. His findings are counterintuitive, imaginative, practical, and above all visionary, giving readers a glimpse of how everyone and everything—from corporations to governments, nations to individuals—must evolve in the Google era. Along the way, he looks under the hood of a car designed by its drivers, ponders a worldwide university where the students design their curriculum, envisions an airline fueled by a social network, imagines the open-source restaurant, and examines a series of industries and institutions that will soon benefit from this book's central question. The result is an astonishing, mind-opening book that, in the end, is not about Google. It's about you.",

      "description": "Rosie Sanders, often described as the best painter of the world's most famous fruit, has devoted years to researching this book and submitting the apples to hour upon hour of meticulous observation. In 144 beautifully detailed watercolours she depicts the unrivalled range of form, colour and texture which characterize such varieties as Beauty of Bath, Peasgood Nonsuch, Cox's Orange Pippin and Egremont Russet. Painted with their blossom, twig and leaf, Rosie offers detailed descriptions of each apple's aroma, flavour and season as well as something of the history of each variety. The book is enhanced by a practical essay on apple growing by Harry Baker, fruit officer for many years at the Royal Horticultural Society and one of Britain’s foremost authorities on apple growing.",

      "description": "Research paper from the year 2013 in the subject Business economics - Business Management, Corporate Governance, grade: A+, Webster University, course: BUSN 6120-2R, language: English, abstract: When reflecting on technology, and the progress that we have made in the last ten years, it is hard to imagine where we would be today without it. We as a society have integrated technology into our lives every single day. A large part of this is due to the ability to connect to the world with our fingertips whenever and wherever we may be. Whether we are surfing the web, listening to music, face timing with our friends and or loved ones, or simply checking in on our social networks. Technology has become a norm and a hygiene factor of our society that most of us could not live without. Apple Inc. and its former CEO, Steve Jobs deserve a substantial amount of credit for these changes. They have led the way in innovation, user friendliness, and ascetically pleasing products that many have tried to contend with and have had no success. Apple Inc. has created a brand so powerful, that their products themselves have become fashionable and almost a never-ending trend. Their brand loyalty is so deep that consumers will stand in lines for not hours but, days awaiting the release of the newest product, even if the changes that are made to it are minimal. They are the first and only company to create a line of products that seamlessly integrate together, and are accessible anywhere with a cellphone signal. However, many question the company’s viability due to the recent passing of former CEO Steve Jobs. Will Apple Inc. be able to continue in its predecessor’s footsteps? Or will Apple Inc. dwindle away like last years fashion trend? This paper will examine Apple Inc. using a SWOT Analysis, and will bring to light Apple Inc. areas of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats.",
